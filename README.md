## âœ… **Loading Screen Timing is Already Correct**

The loading screen:
1. **Appears immediately** when login is submitted
2. **Shows for exactly 1 second** (1000 milliseconds)
3. **Automatically transitions** to the appropriate dashboard

### **Current Flow:**
1. User enters username and code
2. Clicks "Enter" button
3. Login form fades out immediately
4. Loading screen appears with animated graduation cap
5. After exactly 1 second, loading screen disappears
6. User is taken to their dashboard (admin or student)

The timing is already set to exactly one second as you requested! The loading screen provides a nice visual transition and gives users feedback that their login is being processed. ðŸŽ‰
